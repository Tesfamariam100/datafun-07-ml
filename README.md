# datafun-07-ml
Machine learning for predictive analytics

Project Name: DataFun-07-ml
Purpose
This project aims to serve as a starting point for data analysis and machine learning tasks. It provides a structured setup for managing dependencies, version control, and documentation.

Getting Started
Create Repository: In your browser, create a new GitHub repository named datafun-07-ml or datafun-07-applied with the default README.md. Follow naming conventions for repositories.

Clone Repository: Clone the newly created repository to your local machine's Documents folder using Git clone command or via VS Code.

git clone <repository_url>
Create Virtual Environment: Set up a project virtual environment named .venv in the root project folder. In the VS Code terminal:

python3 -m venv .venv
Activate Virtual Environment: Activate the project virtual environment. In the VS Code terminal:

On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.venv\Scripts\activate
Manage Project Requirements:

Install dependencies listed in the project specification.
bash
Copy code
pip install <dependency1> <dependency2> ...
Freeze your requirements to requirements.txt:
bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Add .gitignore: Add a useful .gitignore file to the root project folder to exclude files and directories not to be tracked by Git.

Document Process in README.md: Document the project purpose, virtual environment setup, and commands used for version control and running the code.

Version Control
Git Add and Commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup project structure and dependencies"
Git Push to GitHub:


git push origin main
Running the Code
Document instructions for running your code, if applicable.
Conclusion
This README.md provides a structured guide to set up the project, manage dependencies, version control, and documentation. It's designed to streamline the workflow and facilitate collaboration on data analysis and machine learning tasks.
